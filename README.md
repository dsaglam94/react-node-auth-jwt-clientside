  ### Why this project
  
Authentication is a big part of most websites. Using NextAuth, passport.js, Firebase, etc. ready to use authentication providers made me try creating authentication process from scratch using only node.js with certain packages. Implementing this logic into the front-end was very informative and challenging with React.
